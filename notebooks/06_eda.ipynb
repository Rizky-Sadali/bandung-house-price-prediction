    "## 1. Limitations of the Current Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "While this dataset provides a valuable \"signal\" of the Bandung property market, it is important to acknowledge three critical limitations in its current state:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. The \"Static Snapshot\" Limitation (Temporal Bias)\n",
    "Currently, the data represents a single window of time (September\u2013October 2025).\n",
    "* **No Velocity:** A snapshot has no movement. We cannot tell if prices in Bandung are currently rising (appreciating) or falling (crashing).\n",
    "* **No Seasonality:** Real estate markets often fluctuate based on the time of year (e.g., higher activity during school holidays). This 2-month sample cannot capture those annual cycles.\n",
    "* **Unknown \"Time-on-Market\":** We cannot distinguish between fresh listings and \"stale\" listings that have been sitting unsold for months because they are overpriced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. The \"Asking Price\" Bias\n",
    "The dataset consists entirely of **Listing Prices** (what sellers *want*), not **Transaction Prices** (what buyers actually *pay*).\n",
    "* **Sentiment vs. Reality:** Asking prices represent seller aspiration. Final sales prices are typically 5\u201315% lower after negotiation.\n",
    "* **The \"Upward Skew\":** Consequently, our calculated averages likely overestimate the true cost of housing in Bandung.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. The \"District Grouping\" Issue (Spatial Granularity)\n",
    "In our analysis, we grouped homes by `Kecamatan` (District).\n",
    "* **Hidden Heterogeneity:** A district like *Coblong* contains both ultra-luxury villas (Dago Atas) and dense student housing. Averaging them into a single number hides the massive variety within the district. Real estate value is often defined by specific streets, not broad administrative borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Roadmap: Future Possibilities for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform this project from a descriptive analysis into a predictive engine, we propose the following advancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Longitudinal Data Collection (Time-Series)\n",
    "**Goal:** Collect data consistently over a 12-month period.\n",
    "* **Why it matters:** This would allow us to build a **Market Trend Index**. We could answer questions like *\"Is Gedebage heating up?\"* or *\"Are prices in Setiabudi stagnating?\"*\n",
    "* **Gentrification Detection:** By tracking price changes over time, we could identify neighborhoods that are rapidly becoming expensive, spotting investment opportunities before the general market does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Econometric Modeling: The Hedonic Pricing Model\n",
    "**Goal:** Move beyond simple averages to a multivariate regression model that explains *why* a house costs what it costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is a Hedonic Model?**\n",
    "In economics, the \"Hedonic\" theory treats a house not as a single object, but as a **\"Bundle of Attributes\"** (like a shopping cart full of different items).\n",
    "* **The Theory:** A buyer isn't just buying \"a house\"; they are buying specific amounts of utility: 200m\u00b2 of land, 3 bedrooms, 1 garage, and 10 minutes of saved commute time.\n",
    "* **The Math:** The model uses regression analysis to assign a specific \"Price Tag\" (Coefficient) to each of these attributes.\n",
    "    * *Formula:* $Price = (Size \\times A) + (Bedrooms \\times B) + (Location \\times C) + Error$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Output (The \"Why\")**\n",
    "Instead of just predicting a price, this model gives us explanatory power. It can quantify the marginal value of specific features in the Bandung market:\n",
    "* *\"Each additional bedroom adds **50 Million IDR** to the property value.\"*\n",
    "* *\"Each kilometer further from Gedung Sate reduces the value by **5%**.\"*\n",
    "* *\"Properties with 'Main Road Access' command a **20% premium** over those in alleys.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Implementation Requirements (What We Need)**\n",
    "To build this model, we need to upgrade our data collection to capture more than just the basics:\n",
    "* **Granular Location:** Calculate precise distances to key landmarks (e.g., Toll Gates, CBD, Universities, Malls).\n",
    "* **Quality Attributes:** Scrape specific text details: *Does it have a swimming pool? Is it furnished? How wide is the access road (masuk mobil)?*\n",
    "* **Structural Details:** Number of floors, electricity capacity (watts), and certification type (SHM vs. HGB).\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Advanced Spatial Analytics (Heatmaps)\n",
    "**Goal:** Abandon administrative borders in favor of **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**.\n",
    "* **The Concept:** Instead of coloring a whole district one color, we plot a smooth \"weather map\" of prices.\n",
    "* **The Output:** This would reveal precise \"Hot Zones\" (e.g., a cluster of expensive homes around a specific international school) that might otherwise be invisible on a standard district map."
